English Teacher Adi wants to calculate number of students passing the average grade of the class.
Below are the list of the scores his students get during their last test. 
70, 75, 60, 70, 85, 90, 90, 75, 100, 96, 82, 45, 98, 45, 60, 65, 51, 86, 56, 79
Please create code to calculate and print out the result in the console for:
  1. Total of scores of the class
  2. Total students of the class
  3. The average score of the class
  4. How many students get score above average?
Tips: you might need to use 2 loops, first to calculate the average, and the second to get number of students above average score.
Result: 
Total scores: 1478
Total students: 20
Score average: 73.9
Students above average: 11 students


Create code to print out even number between number a and b (a and b are included)
Tips: put the result inside array named evenNumbers, use another variable to be the index of the array 
Example: a = 2, b = 9
Result:
Even numbers: 2 - 4 - 6 - 8


Create code to print out even and odd numbers between number a and b (a and b are included)
Tips: put the result inside array named evenNumbers and oddNumbers, use different variables to be the index of the array 
Example: a = 2, b = 9
Result:
Even numbers: 2 - 4 - 6 - 8
Odd numbers: 3 - 5 - 7 - 9

Create code to accept user input of number, while the number given by user is not an odd number, keep on requesting another input.
